🚀 100 Days of Coding – DSA Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! 🌟
This repository is where I document my progress, challenges, and solutions while diving deep into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

💡 Short-term Goal: Master the fundamentals of DSA step by step — building a strong foundation that will help me in problem-solving, interviews, and real-world development.

🏹 Current Focus

🔸 Sharpening my JAVA
basics (loops, functions, input/output, etc.)
🔸 Building problem-solving skills with Arrays (searching, frequency, largest/smallest element, subarrays, etc.)
🔸 Practicing Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, + exploring Merge/Quick Sort soon 🚀)
